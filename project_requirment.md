## **📌 Project Requirements**  

### **1️⃣ Core Functionality**  
✅ The agent should allow remote execution of **shell commands** via an **API request**.  
✅ It should **receive HTTP requests over SSL** (self-signed certificate).  
✅ API requests must be **authenticated** (API key or JWT).  
✅ The agent should execute the **command securely** and **send the output** to a provided **callback URL**.  
✅ It should run on a **custom port** (e.g., `8443` instead of `443`).  

---

### **2️⃣ Security Requirements**  
🔒 Use **self-signed SSL certificates** to encrypt communication.  
🔒 Restrict **command execution** to prevent harmful actions (e.g., `rm -rf /`).  
🔒 Implement **authentication** using API keys or JWT.  
🔒 Allow execution **only from trusted IPs** (optional).  
🔒 Configure **firewall (UFW)** to only allow traffic on the custom port.  
🔒 Implement **logging** to track executed commands and requests.  

---

### **3️⃣ Deployment & Automation**  
🚀 The agent should be installed and configured using an **automated script** (`setup_agent.sh`).  
🚀 It must **automatically start on boot** (using `systemd` or similar).  
🚀 The script should install dependencies and configure **SSL, firewall, and API authentication**.  

---

### **4️⃣ API Requirements**  
📡 API Endpoint: `/execute`  
📡 Request **must include**:  
   - **Command** to execute  
   - **Callback URL** to send the output  
   - **Authentication header**  

📡 Response should return:  
   - Execution **status** (success/failure)  
   - **Command output** (stdout/stderr)  

📡 Example API Request:  
```json
{
  "command": "ls -la",
  "callback_url": "https://example.com/webhook"
}
```

📡 Example API Response:  
```json
{
  "output": "total 8\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 4096 Mar 23 12:34 file.txt"
}
```

---

### **5️⃣ SaaS Considerations**  
💡 The agent should be **easy to deploy** across multiple servers.  
💡 A **central SaaS dashboard** can manage multiple agents.  
💡 Each agent instance should have a **unique API key** for authentication.  

---

### **6️⃣ Future Enhancements (Optional)**  
✅ Support **JWT authentication** for better security.  
✅ Implement **command whitelisting** (only allow specific commands).  
✅ Add **agent auto-update** functionality.  
✅ Store logs for **audit and debugging**.
